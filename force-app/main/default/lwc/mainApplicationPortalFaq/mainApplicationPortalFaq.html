                        <p class="answerpara">Yes. Requirements for each lender are different. They each have unique criteria, and current market conditions will play a factor. With that said, keep in mind it is a soft pull to find out whether you may be approved, meaning it won’t affect your credit score to review what offers are available for your situation. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain by applying and, once preapproved; you can then determine which option is best for you.</p>
